# Needs Vetting

Resources listed here were recommended but require me to properly vet them before I can recommend them.

- [**Free Code Camp:**](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) Learn web development through a cirriculum for free.
- [**Scrimba:**](https://scrimba.com/) Scrimba lets you play around with the instructor's code directly inside the screencast.
